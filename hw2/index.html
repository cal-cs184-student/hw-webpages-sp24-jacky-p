<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p align="middle">
    This assignment implements various aspects in modifying meshes. The first section deals with Bezier curves and de Casteljau Subdivision, which are used 
    to model smooth curves and surfaces, first in 1D then in more dimensions. The second section is on triangle meshes and halfedge data structure, where functions on 
    Phong shading, edge flip and split, and loop subdivision are implemented. These functions modify meshes in order for them to appear more accurate and smoother.

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p align="middle">
    De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive algorithm that splits line segments (in this case line segments between points of the Bezier curve) 
    with points and continues to do so with the new points generated from the previous recursive step until it converges to the single desired final point.
    This desired final point is the point that lies on the Bezier curve at the parameter t.
    
    For Part 1, in BezierCurve::evaluateStep(...) I implemented a for loop which iterated through the parameter vector "points" which consists of
    Vector2D elements that represent coordinate points. While iterating through each point in "points", a linear interpolation was calculated with
    the current point and next point (i + 1). The resulting point was then added to a vector of intermediate points which is returned at the end
    of the function, populated with all the intermediate points evaluated at the step of the de Cateljau's algorithm.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p align="middle">
    Bezier surfaces can also be evaluated by de Casteljau's algorithm, one must linearly interpolate first in one direction and then in the other, 
    in this case we do it through (u, v), and we are also working with Vector3D coordinates rather than Vector2D coordinates. In separable 1D de 
    Casteljau's algorithm the coordinates are first evaluated through the in u space, once all the final points are found in the u space they are 
    then passed in to be linearly interpolated in the v space. This then results in a surface point, thus the de Casteljau algorithm being applied 
    to a Bezier surface.

</p>

<p align="middle">
  Implementation for BezierPatch::evaluateStep(...) is very similar to Part 1, although in this case the parameter is a Vector3D not Vector2D. It
  is a for loop that goes through all the points, linearly interpolates them with their next neighboring point and returns its intermediate
  points.

  For BezierPatch::evaluate1D(...), I implemented a while loop that continues to interate until a single point remains (the final point). Within
  the while loop BezierPatch::evaluateStep(...) is called on the "points" parameter and its result is assigned back to "points" to be passed in 
  at the next step (iteration of loop) until the result converges to a single coordinate point, which is then returned.

  BezierPatch::evaluate(...) deals with the u and v spaces, for this function I interated through the 2D controlPoints vector passing in the 
  vector at each index into evaluate1D with u as the scalar interpolation parameter. The resulting points are added to a vector of Vector3D
  points, where after the for loop terminates it is passed in to evaluate1D with the v scalar interpolation parameter. This produces the 
  point on the surface and is returned.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p align="middle">
  To compute the area-weighted avergae of normals at this vertex I intereated through all the current halfedge's neighboring triangles by its halfedges and corresponding vertices.
  Since the halfedges iterate in a single direction, this prevent double counting of triangles when computing the area 
  weighted total. In the while loop the directional vectors of the edges are computed by subtracting the two vertices of the incident 
  triangle from the originating vertex. The cross product of these edge length vectors is then 
  divided by the magnitude of the cross product and multiplied by 1/2 to get the area of the triangle. This is then multipled to the
  triangle's face's normal and added to the area-weighted total Vector3D, where then outside the loop it is divided by its magitude to 
  normalize the result. Finally, the function returns this result which is the approximate unit normal at this vertex.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p align="middle">
    To implement the flipEdge function I first drew the diagram provided of the two triangles with a shared edge and labeled every part of it according to the flipEdge rules. 
    From there I created various varibles to label the pointers of each part of the diagram and used them to when reassigning. I reassigned the vertices' and faces'
    halfegdes first and then used setNeighbors to reassign the halfedges (its next, twin, vertex, edge, and face). Finally, I return the edge that was intially passed in but
    updated now with its reassignments.

</b>
<p align="middle">
  A bug I had trouble with was only using the setNeighbors() function to update the halfedges and forgetting to assign the vertices' and faces' halfedge attribute to its 
  new flipped value as well, which was causing incorrect and odd flips like disapearing faces.
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p align="middle">
    Following the same process as in part 4, I drew the diagram of an edge split, labeled all new elements and relabeled elements that would need to be reassigned 
    and used this diagram as a guide to write the function. In the function, I first declared all the variables that would represent the pointers, then created the new faces, 
    edges, and vertex. For the edges that were created, I also set its "isNew" attribute to true to be later used in part 6.
     Then assigned the vertices', faces', and edges' corresponding halfedges. Afterwards, I assigned all of the halfegdes' new corresponding attributes after the split 
     with setNeighbors().

<b>
    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p align="middle">
    Intially I was adding too many new edges since I had diffculty with reassigning some of the edges that were already in the mesh and although in part 5 the 
    function seemed to be work correctly, these bugs presented themselves in part 6. I then figured out how to correctly reassign the edge to be split and kept all
    the edges the mesh originally had and reduced the new edges I was adding down to 2 rather than 4. This fix then allowed my part 6 to work as well.
</p>
<br>



<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p align="middle">
    For Part 6, I closely followed the workflow provided in the doc-string of the function. First, I iterated through all the vertices with a for loop and calculated its new 
    position with the formula provided in the spec and for retrieving all its neighboring vertices for "original_neighbor_postion_sum" part of the formula, I had a while loop inside each iteration
    of the for loop. At the end of this for loop I set all the vertices to isNew = false since they are the original vertices of the mesh and assign its newPosition to the calculated 
    position. I then loop through all the edges of the mesh with a while loop and calculated the positions of all the new vertices with the other formula provided and set this value to 
    the newPosition value of the edge. Afterwards is the loop that deals with splitting the edges. Orginally I had a for loop when dealing with edges but that lead to infinite loops
    since splitting the edges kept creating more therefore the increment of the for loop kept on going since it never met the edgesEnd() condition. To fix this I then implemented it through
    a while loop, in the while loop I checked if both vertices of the edge were from the original mesh and if so split the edge and set the returned vertex to isNew true and its newPosition to 
    the edges newPosition. I also had a bug here where I just directly set the position of the new vertex and disregarded the newPosition so fixed it by setting the newPosition. I then looped through the 
   
    edges again to flip them here I checked the conditions where if the edge was new and if one vertex was new and the other old, if so then it'd flip the edge. Finally I iterate through all the vertices again 
    and set it's position to the value in its newPosition. The final bug I encountered was forgetting to set the original edges in the mesh to isNew = false so I added that in a while 
    loop before the splitting loop and that allowed Part 6 to function properly.

    The sharp corners and edges after loop subdivision appear to become more smooth and rounded. By pre-splitting some edges before the loop subdivision does reduce this effect, the pre-split edges after loop

<p align="middle">
    Pre-processing the cube with edge splits and flips does aid in the cube being subdivided more symmetrically since it helps it keep its flat sides. Since the original 
    mesh does not have many triangles to begin with when they are all split and flipped in a loop they tend to lose shape since loop subdivision creates a mesh with increased 
    equal sized triangles thus losing information and symmetry the original shape had. By splitting and flipping before loop subdivision it creates more triangles that then keep more 
    information of their original shape. For example, in the cube each side face is represented by two triangles, when in a loop you split 
    these triangles and then flip them so the cube losses its original corners since the single triangles 
    of the corner were split and flipped making them more rounded. With more triangles that are smaller and closer to the corner the rounded effect of splititng and 
    fliiping is on a much smaller scale thus 
    the overall mesh keeps more of its shape.
